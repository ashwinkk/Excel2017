Dreamt of interacting with minds who have brought new dimensions to conventions? Introducing the Guest Lectures of Excel 2017, all new with the theme “Discover|Define|Defy, lines”. </span></p><p>\t<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A line represents a path we follow. A path that defines us as we explore it. Focussing on new technical ideas and aspects, we bring in a set of diverse speakers who would enlighten us with their experiences on traversing these paths.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><b>Day 1: Discover</b>: Explore the latest technologies and realise how each one of them can bring out a change. To discover the real shift that needs to happen to go from believing that you have some innate calling, something you were \"meant\" to do, to understanding that you create your own sense of meaning and purpose in life.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><b>Day 2: Define</b>: Get to know the latest innovations and get dissolved into them. Develop a perspective on career objective, what one has to aspire to be and where one should hope to go in their work life. Taking in account practical and objective views, reflect a career dream as success follows a well thought out plan.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><b>Day 3: Defy</b>: A guide to venture into something out of the box. Giving up well off jobs to venture into the unknown or overcoming stereotypes that control our society is the leap of faith being glorified. Get to realise that life make or break moments which are hinged on the crucial step of “Deciding to Act”.</span></p><p><br></p>",
